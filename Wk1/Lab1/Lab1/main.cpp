  main.cpp
  Lab1: This is a program that uses two classes. Each class will be in a separate source file 
        with an appropriate header file. The first class is Die. It has a data member to indicate 
        the number of sides and a member function that returns the value of a single roll of a 
        single die. The second class is LoadedDie. It also has a single data member that indicates 
        the number of sides and a member function that returns the value of a single roll of a 
        single die. In this case it returns values that are higher than normal.
